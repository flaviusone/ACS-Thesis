\chapter{Implementation}
\label{chapter:implementation}

In this chapter, we present the structure of our application and how all the technologies work together, starting with the \labelindexref{Overview}{sec:overview} section.

Secondly, we describe the back-end \labelindexref{Django Data Models}{sec:django-models} that we used to implement the REST API.

Then, we present how Tastypie uses the Django data models to generate the API resource with its corresponding schema in section \labelindexref{REST API}{sec:api}.

Finally, in the \labelindexref{React Components}{sec:react-components} section, we present how these work together to explore the resource from the given API URI and how they auto-generate UI components based on the received JSON data.

\section{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

The web application's goal is to demonstrate that an API can be explored and UI components can be auto-generated from the data that it receives. Therefore, for this to work, we established a Django based back-end that holds the requested or modified data, and a REST API using Tastypie. Next, we implemented our front-end in React to explore the data received from the API and generate custom components. A general overview of all the application components and how they interact is presented in \labelindexref{Figure}{img:schema-generala}. %\lstinputlisting[label={lst:flex-flow},caption=Flexbox flex-flow usage ,language=html]{src/code/html/flex-flow.html}

\fig[scale=0.5]{src/img/schema-generala.png}{img:schema-generala}{General application architecture}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \texttt{Register} - First,i the Django models classes are are defined (\labelindexref{Section}{sec:django-models}) and the SQL database tables are created and populated. After that, a Django Tastypie Resource is declared using the previous defined models (\labelindexref{Section}{sec:api}) and the \texttt{Register} function is called using this resource to create the API.
	\item \texttt{Initial GET} - The UI logic uses two AJAX calls (HTTP GETs) to retrieve data and schema about a specified endpoint URI, with the purpose of rendering generic components.
	\item \texttt{Response} - The Tastypie API queries the database from the Django server and returns responses to the previous two requests. The data returned is structured as a JSON and it describes the objects that are stored at that specific endpoint. Also along with the data the API returns the JSON Schema that describes the fields of the resource.
	\item \texttt{GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE} - Finally the UI renders the data received from the initial GET. Now the user can trigger browser events like deleting specific panels, adding new data or exploring and modifying existing data, thus sending the corresponding HTTP requests to the API for the updates.
	\item \texttt{Update DB} - Once the API recieves new requests from the UI, it queries the database and updates it correspondingly trough the hydrate/dehydrate cycle.
	
\end{enumerate}

The following sections get into more detail on each of the steps described above.

\section{Django Data Models}
\label{sec:django-models}

For the purpose of the project we only needed a functional REST API and a way to render the main HTML page. The first step of establishing the REST API was to define the Django data models. For testing purposes we defined a \texttt{Post} entity, similar to a usual blog post, with the following properties:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{title} - The title of the post.
	\item \texttt{author} - A related entity that describes the data about the author of the specific post.
	\item \texttt{created\_at} - A field that describes the date and time the post was created at.
	\item \texttt{content} - The actual text of the post.
\end{itemize}

The \texttt{author} field is important for the purpose of demonstrating the capability to explore related fields and describe them. The \texttt{author} data model is actually inherited from Django's \texttt{contrib.auth.models User} model, which is composed of specific fields as: \texttt{username, email, first name, last name, date joined} and also fields that we chose to exclude trough filters like: \texttt{password, is\_active, is\_staff, is\_superuser}.

In \labelindexref{Listing}{lst:post-model} we present the Django Post model class implementation. As all Django model classes, it inherits the \texttt{models.Model} class and its standard field types.

\lstinputlisting[label={lst:post-model},caption=Post model class,language=Python]{src/code/python/post-model.py}

Field types are classes that describe and encapsulate certain type of data. As it is presented in the listing above, field types can hold additional parameters like \texttt{help\_text}, which is used to provide additional information about the field and subsequently displayed in the REST API's JSON Schema. Another optional parameter is \texttt{DateTimeField}'s \texttt{auto\_now\_add} which is set to \texttt{True} to automatically initialize the field to the date when the object is first created.

\section{REST API}
\label{sec:api}

The REST API set up trough Django Tastypie, is the most important part of our back-end. It takes the data models described in the previous section and outputs them in a RESTful way. We will next present how we set up the API and also its resulted output.

\subsection{Resources}
\label{sub-sec:resources}

Previously we described the data models for a generic blog post and its related author model. Based on those models we created API resources that are able to expose that data.

\subsubsection{Post Resource}
\label{sub-sub-sec:post-resource}

In \labelindexref{Listing}{lst:cod-resursa-post} we present the implementation for the \texttt{PostResource} resource. The resource inherits the base methods from the \texttt{ModelResource} class that itself is a subclass of \texttt{Resource}, designed to work with Djangoâ€™s \texttt{Models}. 

\lstinputlisting[label={lst:cod-resursa-post},caption=Post resource,language=Python]{src/code/python/cod-resursa-post.py}	

The inner \texttt{Meta} class allows for class-level configuration of how the Resource should behave. Therefore, we can set parameters like \texttt{resource\_name}, \texttt{authorization} and the most important, \texttt{queryset}. The \texttt{queryset} provides the resource with the set of Django models to respond with. Also, because the \texttt{author} field is a related data model, we want to provide it with a \texttt{ForeignKey} to the \texttt{UserResource} for it to retrieve a link to the related URI. A more detail output of the API will be presented in \labelindexref{Section}{sub-sec:output}

In case of a related component the JSON Schema should describe the URI of the parent resource. For this, as seen in lines 11-14 in the above listing,  we overwrote the \texttt{build\_schema} method in the \texttt{Post} resource class to add another field called \texttt{resource} that would expose the \texttt{author} resource URI.


\subsubsection{User Resource}
\label{sub-sub-sec:user-resource}

The \texttt{UserResource} follows the same design that we presented in the section before, on the \texttt{PostResource}. While it will not have a modified \texttt{build\_schema} method it will have some additional \texttt{Meta} fields. \labelindexref{Listing}{lst:cod-resursa-user} shows only what changed in the \texttt{Meta} class. For security reasons we excluded the fields like \texttt{password, is\_active, is\_staff, is\_superuser} trough the \texttt{excludes} option. The \texttt{filtering} option provides the resource with a list of fields that will accept client filtering on. In this case by setting the `\texttt{'username': ALL} option we can now use specific queries like \texttt{api/v1/author/?username=flaviusone\&format=json}.

\lstinputlisting[label={lst:cod-resursa-user},caption=User resource,language=Python]{src/code/python/cod-resursa-user.py}

After setting up the resources, we continued by setting up the API for the URL dispatcher in Django's \texttt{urls.py} file. Next, we instantiated the resources and we called the Tastypie provided constructor \texttt{Api(api\_name='v1')} with a parameter for setting an API name. In the end we called the \texttt{register()} method on the API object with both resources as parameters and we added the \texttt{url()} call in the \texttt{urlpatterns} array as follows \texttt{url(r'\^{}api/', include(v1\_api.urls))}

\subsection{Data Output}
\label{sub-sec:output}

With the API properly setup we now have output on the resource specific URI, in our case \texttt{/posts/api/v1/post/?format=json}. In \labelindexref{Listing}{lst:data-resursa-post} we present a sample output of the \texttt{Post} resource (only one object displayed).

\lstinputlisting[label={lst:data-resursa-post},caption= Post resource data output,language=Java]{src/code/js/json-data-post.js}	

The listing above shows the return of a single object with two proprieties: \texttt{meta} and \texttt{objects}. The \texttt{meta} object provides information about the number of objects displayed by, in the response. Some important parameters here, are \texttt{limit} and \texttt{next}, which describe how many objects can be returned in one response, and what is the path for the next page of objects, in case the response is too big and the system automatically splits the response into separate calls to reduce bandwidth. 

The \texttt{objects} property describes an array of objects that are located at the specified resource. The data is also described in JSON format, but it can also be formatted as XML by using the \texttt{?format=xml} in the request call. In the case of the \texttt{author} field, the API specifies the related path to the location of the data, by obeying HATEOAS principles. By further exploring this URI we get the following additional JSON object, presented in \labelindexref{Listing}{lst:json-author-1}, that further describes the author object. 


\lstinputlisting[label={lst:json-author-1},caption= Author entry,language=Java]{src/code/js/json-author-1.js}


Besides the data output of the \texttt{Post} resource we can also access the JSON Schema available at  \texttt{/posts/api/v1/post/schema/?format=json}. The output of this call can be found in \labelindexref{Appendix}{lst:schema-resursa-post} and \labelindexref{Appendix}{lst:schema-resursa-author}. The JSON Schema describes the \texttt{type} of each field that is used by the front-end to generate UI components. 

The standard types described by the Schema can be \texttt{string, integer, datetime} and \texttt{related}. In the case of a \texttt{related} type object the front-end logic will explore the additional \texttt{resource} parameter and display the available data. Another important field used by the front-end logic is the \texttt{readonly} attribute, that points if the object field is editable.	

\section{React Components}
\label{sec:react-components}

As we presented in the \labelindexref{Overview}{sec:overview} section, the main element of the project is the reactive UI. The interface is built to be agnostic of any changes in the back-end, by generating specific components based on the data provided and the JSON Schema. In this section we will present how the React components are structured and how they work together.

\subsection{Component Structure}
\label{sub-sec:component-structure}

By its nature, a web application built in React is composed of multiple reusable \texttt{React Components}. In \labelindexref{Figure}{img:generic-form} we present a simplified version of the UI component structure that describes the following elements:

\fig[scale=0.45]{src/img/components.png}{img:components}{React components structure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{<FormBox/>} - This is the main component that encapsulates all other. This component also has the main purpose of calling the AJAX requests that are requested by other components that are its children.
	\item \texttt{<Navbar/>} - This is not in fact a specific React component but its a structure composed of all the elements that form the page's navigation bar, that are actually react components imported from the \texttt{react-bootstrap} package. Some of the components used include:
	  \begin{itemize}
	  	\item \texttt{<Navbar/>} and \texttt{<Nav/>} components, used for encapsulating the URL input form.
	  	\item \texttt{<Input/>} component that describes a simple input form for the URL options.
	  	\item \texttt{<ButtonInput/>} component that describes the submit button for the input form described above
	  \end{itemize}
	\item \texttt{<FormList/>} - This component receives an array of objects from its parent and generates and encapsulates the \texttt{<GenericForm/>} components.
	\item \texttt{<GenericForm/>} - This represents the main component that the user interacts with. It also encapsulates components for each type of object. We will continue to present this component in further detail in  \labelindexref{Section}{sub-sec:generic-form}.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Data Flow}
\label{sub-sec:data-flow}

We presented in \labelindexref{Section}{sub-sec:react} the data flow within the React framework and we explained how components have \texttt{states} and \texttt{proprieties} as the main mechanism of storing and transmitting data. Next, we will describe how data flows in our application from the API trough the components and back. Based on the diagram presented in \labelindexref{Figure}{img:data-flow}, we can summarize the process in the following steps:

\fig[scale=0.45]{src/img/data-flow.png}{img:data-flow}{Data flow inside components}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The \texttt{FormBox} component, is the center piece of communication with the REST API. On the initial render this component calls an AJAX GET to retrieve \texttt{data} and \texttt{schema} from the resource URI. The data received is structured as an object array as presented in \labelindexref{Section}{sub-sec:output}
	\item Next, the objects array and schema are passed to the \texttt{FormList} upon its rendering as \texttt{properties}.
	\item Once the \texttt{FormList} \texttt{render()} function is called, it takes the received data and for each object it renders a \texttt{GenericForm}. The generated \texttt{GenericForm} components will also receive the \texttt{schema} along with the object data in its \texttt{proprieties}.
	\item With the received data, the \texttt{GenericForm} components can now render the corresponding elements based on the \texttt{schema object}. After the \texttt{GenericForm} component is rendered, it can now be added, deleted or edited by the user. When the user presses the submit button on the component, the new data is sent trough a callback that can look like \texttt{handleCommentEdit}. This callback is also inherited trough props from the component's parent. In this case, \texttt{FormList} also inherits the callback from its parent \texttt{FormBox}. Therefore in the end the new data arrives at the \texttt{FormBox} component.
	\item The last step consists of the \texttt{FormBox} component to trigger the AJAX call with the new data received from its children. The AJAX call can be of different types:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item POST - If a new object is added trough a modified \texttt{GenericForm} that describes a form with empty fields that acts as an \texttt{AddForm}
		\item DELETE - If a form is deleted by the user.
		\item PATCH - If a form component changes its values and triggers and edit action.\\
	\end{enumerate}
	
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Generic Form}
\label{sub-sec:generic-form}

The \texttt{GenericForm} is the core component of the reactive UI. Trough its behavior, the UI can auto-generate components without having a preset template from the beginning. Also trough the \texttt{GenericForm} component the UI can auto-explore and re-render further discovered data. 

For the component to be able to accommodate any type of data several auxiliary components have been created. In \labelindexref{Figure}{img:generic-form} we present the internal structure of the \texttt{GenericForm} component.  

\fig[scale=0.35]{src/img/genericform.png}{img:generic-form}{GenericForm component}

The figure shows four different components that describe the four available types in our API (\texttt{string, integer, datetime, related}). It is important to mention that these four types of data are not the only ones possible. We could also have components that describe \texttt{boolean} data or \texttt{enumeration} data for example. Next, we will continue to describe the structure of the four data types.

The \texttt{GenericForm}'s \texttt{render} function follows a simple algorithm described in \labelindexref{Algorithm}{algo1}. It has the main purpose to return a \texttt{div} container populated with \texttt{content}. This \texttt{content} is actually an array of HTML elements returned by the specific components that form the \texttt{GenericForm} object. To initialize the \texttt{type} specific components, the algorithm takes each \texttt{property} and searches for its \texttt{type} in the general \texttt{schema} object. Once the \texttt{type} is known the proper component is initialized by receiving additional data as React \texttt{props}. These \texttt{props} include the actual \texttt{key:value} property, the \texttt{schema} object (used mainly for related objects and also for readonly objects) and the \texttt{display\_state}.

The \texttt{display\_state} is a \texttt{GenericForm} state that can have two values: \texttt{show} or \texttt{edit}. This state describes if the component can be edited by the user. When a user presses the component \texttt{Edit} button the state changes from its default \texttt{show} value to \texttt{edit} and as any \texttt{setState} function call, triggers a component re-render. Upon the new render, the \texttt{GenericForm} component will now send the new \texttt{display\_state} for its children that will change their state accordingly.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
$content \leftarrow []$

\ForEach{property in object}{
	$type \leftarrow $ type of property extracted from the schema object
	
	\Switch{type}{
		\Case{string}{
			content.push(StringComponent(property, schema, display\_state))
			}
		\Case{integer}{
			content.push(IntegerComponent(property, schema, display\_state))
			}
		\Case{datetime}{
			content.push(DateTimeComponent(property, schema, display\_state))
			}
		\Case{related}{
			content.push(RelatedComponent(property, schema, display\_state))
			}
	}
}
\Return content
\label{algo1}
\caption{GenericForm render algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

As we described until now the \texttt{GenericForm} component is a container for data components. We will now follow to present the four types of React components that we implemented within our project.

\subsubsection{StringComponent}
\label{sub-sub-sec:string}

The \texttt{StringComponent} is our generic React component that has the role of displaying string type objects. The component also has two states \texttt{show} and \texttt{edit} that facilitate the user to edit it by typing into an editable \texttt{textarea}. Having a \texttt{textarea} input the component must store the current data into its \texttt{state}. Then, the \texttt{textarea} as an \texttt{onChange=\{this.handleChange\}} method applied on it that on a change event calls the \texttt{handleChange} function. This function has the role of setting the new state of the value object for the \texttt{StringComponent}.

\subsubsection{IntegerComponent}
\label{sub-sub-sec:integer}

The \texttt{IntegerComponent} has a similar structure to the \texttt{StringComponent}. In our demo this component is used to display the \texttt{posts} or \texttt{authors} specific \texttt{ids}. 

\subsubsection{DateTimeComponent}
\label{sub-sub-sec:date}

The \texttt{DateTimeComponent} is a more complex component than the \texttt{StringComponent} or \texttt{IntegerComponent}. It receives from its parent trough its \texttt{props} a raw \texttt{date} that is usually formatted as follows \texttt{2015-06-11T14:09:00}. It then takes this value and converts it into 
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and imputs it to a Bootstrap Datepicker component. The Bootstrap Datepicker component is an open source project that can be found at \footnote{\url{http://eonasdan.github.io/bootstrap-datetimepicker/}} and has the role of providing an aesthetic and user friendly interface to chose a date and time for the specific components.

\subsubsection{RelatedComponent}
\label{sub-sub-sec:related}

The \texttt{RelatedComponent} is the most special and important component because it helps demonstrate that auto-exploration of an API and further generation of components can be achieved. The component initially receives the URI of the related component and also the schema object. A simplification of the algorithm behind the \texttt{RelatedComponent} is presented in \labelindexref{Algorithm}{algo2}.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
	
	$mainResource \leftarrow $ schema.resource
	
	loadDataIntoDropdown(mainResource)
	
	\If{edit is pressed}{
		$explore \leftarrow true$
		
		$exploreURI \leftarrow$ selected dropdown data
		
		$newData \leftarrow getDataFromServer(exploreURI)$
		
		$content \leftarrow $ new GenericForm(newData)
		}
	\Return content
	\label{algo2}
	\caption{RelatedComponent render algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

The first step is getting the URI from the \texttt{resource} field in the schema. As an example, this URI may look like \texttt{/posts/api/v1/author/}, and point to the location of all the elements that are available at the resource where the related component URI (eg. \texttt{/posts/api/v1/post/1/}) came from. With this data, the component can now load it into a dropdown for the user to select which object to explore. After the desired resource was selected in the dropdown, when the user presses the \texttt{Edit} button, the state changes from \texttt{explore:false} to \texttt{explore:true}, and the component calls an AJAX GET request to retrieve the data (and schema) about that certain object. With the new data, the component now initializes another \texttt{GenericForm} component that will render it as described in the previous sections.
