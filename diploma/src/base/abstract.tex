% This file contains the abstract of the thesis

Development time is an important topic today, with companies competing against each other in agile software development environments. By reducing the time needed to modify hard coded API URL's between successive deployments and by separating the front-end dependencies from the back-end companies can gain precious time and with that increase their income.

The project aims to provide a front-end application that is agnostic of the back-end structure, providing independence between the two platforms. The application will also be able to auto-generate generic UI components regardless of the data fetched from the API.

\textbf{Keywords}: Web, Front-end, HATEOAS, REST, API, React, Django, python
