Development time is an important topic today, with companies having very strict roadmaps. By both separating the dependencies between the front-end and back-end as well as by generating UI components in an automated way, developers can drastically speed up the development process.

The project aims to provide a front-end application that is agnostic of the back-end structure, providing independence between the two platforms. The application will also be able to auto-generate generic UI components regardless of the data fetched from the API.

\textbf{Keywords}: Web, Front-end, HATEOAS, REST, API, React, Django, Python
